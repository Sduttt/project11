# Assignment 11
8th August 2022
## Full Stack Javascript Web Development Course by [iNeuron](https://ineuron.ai/)

This website is created with core HTML and CSS. It is mobile responsive. It took me almost 10 hours to complete this project.  This project helped me to learn planning for designing a long web page, deviding the HTML in parts to make it easier and more customizable, writing HTML in a more organized process, making webpage responsive using media query. Images and icons are collected from [icons8](https://icons8.com/), [Undraw](https://undraw.co/) and iNeuron.
